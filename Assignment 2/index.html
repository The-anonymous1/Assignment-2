                I'ma say all the words inside my head,<br>
                I'm fired up and tired of,<br>

                    I'm the one at the sail,<br>
                    I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh,<br>

                    I was broken from a young age,<br>
                    Taking my sulkin' to the masses,<br>
                    Writing my poems for the few,<br>
                    That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me,<br>
                    Singing from heartache from the pain,<br>
                    Taking my message from the veins,<br>
                    Speaking my lesson from the brain,<br>
                    Seeing the beauty through the...<br><br>

                    Send a prayer to the ones up above,<br>
                    All the hate that you've heard,<br>
                    Has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh,<br>

                    Building my rain up in the cloud,<br>
                    Falling like ashes to the ground,<br>
                    Hoping my feelings, they would drown,<br>
                    But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin',<br>
                    Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down,<br>
                    It rained down, like…<br><br>
